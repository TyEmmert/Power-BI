### Description

This graph shows the average English grade points for all students in each cohort. The colors represent the different cohorts. The left set of columns are students who didn't receive Tutoring: Literacy, and the other set of students are students who received other types of tutoring.

### Important thoughts

There are students in the data who did not received tutoring across all Quarters/Trimesters. This might not be the best representation of growth as an overall English grade point average.  
Another thought is that students who did not choose to participate in Tutoring: Literacy might not have needed it.

### Key Findings

There was a slight GPA increase for cohort 3-5, and 6-8. The column chart gives a good idea about the average English grades of the students for each cohort. We can see that 10-12 graders had a very low average English grade point. This can be for various reasons, and needs to be further explored in the data. In fact all cohorts do not have impressive average grades for English. This is because most of these students need support in this category, and the support that they received could have been at any interval of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4).
