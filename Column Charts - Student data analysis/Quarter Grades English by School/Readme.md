# Title: Population of students that received tutoring and their grade for that quarter

### Cleaning Methods for Data

Removed pass/fail grades.  
Added column for grade points (A = 4, B = 3, ...).  
Joined Cohort with studentID in English Grades  
Vlookup Dosage Marking Period to English Grades Table with studentID.  
Vlookup English Program to English Grades Table with studentID.

### Description

These 4 charts show the amount of students tutored in any given quarter. It also shows the grade they received for that quarter. The colors represent the the different cohorts that were tutored during that quarter.

### Important thoughts

The data doesn't show how many sessions each student got in order to receive that grade. There could be students in the data that received 1 tutoring session, and then never returned. This isn't an indicator to show a relationship between receiving tutoring, and getting a good grade. It is more to show the type of population of students that were received in each quarter and their respective grades.

### Key Findings

The population of students who received services in Quarter 1 were only 12 students in grade 3-5, and 12 students in grades 6-8. In the following charts, there is an increase in students, and in increase in student populations that have an F for a grade. In particular most of the 10-12, 6-8, and grade 9 in Q3 received an F for Q3. There is a large fluctuation in students for Q2 and Q3. Since this isn't carrying over into Q4, we can suggest that some of these students are not returning for services in the following Quarter.

### Next Steps

The next steps should be to look specifically into how the amount of sessions or dosage a student received in tutoring helped improve their grade.
