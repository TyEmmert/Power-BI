### Description

The chart shows how many A's, B's, C's, D's, and F's each cohort had when they were turored in English, and when they were not tutoring in English.

### Important thoughts

Just because a student chose to not get tutoring in English does not mean that they were a struggling student. It could be possible that they already had a grade that they were happy with in English, and did not need to get tutoring.

### Key Findings

Students in K-2 were able to increase their English average grade to an A with English tutoring.  
There are less A's and B's for students who did not get English tutoring than there are students who did get English tutoring.
Students in 10-12 had more B's with English tutoring than students without Engishing tutoring.
